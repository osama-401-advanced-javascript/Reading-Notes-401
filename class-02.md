- Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
  Running JavaScript without/outside a browser means you are using node.js technology to execute your JavaScript code. This type of usage of javascript typically refers to backend programming where your javascript code will interact with your database and can be used to create RESTful APIs.

What is the difference between a module and a package?
  A package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json file.
A module is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the Node.js require() function.
Note: Since modules are not required to have a package.json file, not all modules are packages. Only modules that have a package.json file are also packages.

- What does the node package manager do?
 npm, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. A plethora of Node.js libraries and applications are published on npm, and many more are added every day. These applications can be searched for on http://npmjs.org/. Once you have a package you want to install, it can be installed with a single command-line command.

**V8 Engine**
  - V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly.

**module**
  - Module in Node. js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application. Each module in Node.

**package**

  - The HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.

**interpreter**
  - Interpreter coverts each high-level program statement, one by one, into the machine code, during program run. Compiled code runs faster while interpreted code runs slower.

**compiler**
  - Compiler transforms code written in a high-level programming language into the machine code, at once, before program runs
